# sopel-inclusivity

Sopel Inclusive Language suggests better wordings when people don't use
inclusive language. It's inspired by [this blog
post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/01/12/hacking-inclusion-by-customizing-a-slack-bot/)
from 18F, who've added a similar feature to their Slack rooms. It only deals
with use of the word "guys" for now, but if there is any other language it
could cover, PRs are welcome.
